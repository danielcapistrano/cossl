    "text": "Remaining Evidence Gaps\n\nEvidence of UCD students’ climate literacy. While this exploratory study allows us to identify students’ self-reported awareness and understanding of the climate crisis, further research needs to be conducted to investigate the levels of climate literacy among UCD students.\nEvidence of the opportunities available in UCD to engage in climate action. The present study shows students perceived as scarce opportunities offered in UCD to engage in actions to address climate change and protect the environment. Further work is needed to compile and articulate the existing initiatives, services and opportunities available in UCD to engage in climate-friendly actions.\nEvidence on students’ preferences to incorporate climate action into their student experience at UCD. The study demonstrates the interest of students in engaging in climate-friendly actions and have further opportunities as part of the UCD student experience and preparation for their professional future. Further research is needed to identify what experiential opportunities students are interested in that could inform programmes and initiatives across the University that could be developed in partnership with relevant stakeholders such as UCDVO Volunteer Programme, UCD Career Service, Student Union, student clubs and societies.\nEvidence on the impact of the climate crisis in students mental health. Even though the results of this exploratory study show that the majority of students anxiety regarding climate change focuses on future generationsn, most students are constantly thinking about the climate crisis and a fair proportion of them reported to be concerned about its current consequences. With growing research exploring sustainable wellbeing - how humans care for themselves, others, and the environment-, further evidence is needed in UCD on the specific impact of climate change has in students’ mental health and overall wellbeing.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n\n\nImportance of climate education research\n\nFunding is needed to address the evidence gaps identified in this study and to develop a research agenda on climate education at UCD that provides evidence-based strategies needed for our students to effectively develop climate literacy and skills necessary to engage in meaningful climate action within and beyond the University. These goals are not only aligned with UCD’s Strategy Plan and commitment to ‘Create a Sustainable Global Society’ but are also part of the commitments of Higher Education Institutions as part of the Public Sector Climate Action Mandate established in Ireland’s Climate Action Plan 2023. This education agenda should have a student-centric approach that identifies and works towards addressing students’ needs and concerns with methodologies that promote the engagement of students as partners in the design, implementation and evaluation of projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nAllocate research funding for internal projects at UCD that create evidence in partnership with students on climate education including knowledge, skills, attitudes and dispositions to take action against climate change.\n\n\n\nNeed for a Climate Curricular Alignment\n\nThe present study demonstrates that students do not rely on UCD as a key source of information about the climate crisis demonstrating the need for a curricular alignment that makes climate change part of the University / College-wide curriculum to allow students to engage with the issue. A ‘climate curricular alignment’in UCD would map the content relevant to climate change across the University / College, coordinate current learning outcomes of different modules and programmes and to map learning trajectories for students’ climate education. Consultation with students should lead the curricular alignment to better understand their needs and concerns and would align with the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development that looks to transform learning environments through whole institutional approaches to promote knowledge, skills, values and dispositions to promote sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nDevelop a ‘climate curricular alignment’ initiative to identify how different programmes and modules could contribute to improving climate knowledge and skills among our students.\n\n\n\nRelevance of experiential opportunities\n\nThe study emphasised the relevance of experiential opportunities for students and the impact these can have on their climate literacy and engagement with climate actions. UCD should work towards articulating existing opportunities for students or creating new ones that are relevant for them to address climate change. The National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development sets concrete outcomes about providing students with experiences of sustainability within education and supporting young people to become agents of change. Partnerships across stakeholders in the University, such as UCDVO Volunteer Programme, UCD Career Service, Student Union, student clubs and societies, are essential in the achievement of these outcomes. For example, helping them to link the knowledge and skills they are developing in their programmes with volunteering and career opportunities that would allow them to engage in meaningful action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nWork in collaboration with areas across the Universtiy to disseminate available opportunities and to create new initiatives for students to engage in climate action, in particular volunteering and career opportunities."

    "text": "Scientific research relies substantially on social surveys to assess knowledge, attitudes and action in relation to climate change issues. The objective of the current project was to develop and test an instrument to measure students’ understandings of, attitudes towards and actions against climate change to establish a baseline for larger research projects on Climate Change Education in Higher Education.\nThe initial questionnaire was designed in September 2021 and included questions tested in previous surveys with Higher Education students. The pre-test for the current project was administered in October 2021 with 15 graduate students. Participants generally provided positive feedback in relation to the length of the questionnaire and the clarity of the questions. Four questions were reformulated due to their length and difficulty in responding using a smartphone.\nWe recruited participants using social media and in class announcements facilitated by module coordinators with the permission of the head of each School. The survey was taken by 169 undergraduate students during the months of October and November 2022. On average, it took 12 minutes to be completed."

    "text": "“There is an important role to be played by higher education institutions (HEIs) if they step up their commitment to all 17 SDGs through their teaching, research, and engagement with the economy and society”- UNESCO 2022\nInstitutes of higher education have been identified as critical actors in driving climate action in a closing window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic climate change 1 2 University faculty and researchers are at the forefront of advancing the knowledge frontier of the drivers and impacts of the climate crisis and adaptation and mitigation strategies. Further, IHEs are tasked with educating and supporting future leaders who will need to deal with the long-term legacy of environmental degradation and have a key role to play in supporting advocacy for transformative social change 3.\nA growing scholarship is conceptualizing how IHEs can be most useful as constructive actors in a time-bound emergency such as climate change4. Thousands of universities, including Irish HEIs, have joined campaigns are responding by made emergency declarations5 and the sector has identified climate change and biodiversity loss as a priority focus6.\nHowever, many argue that IHE’s response to the climate crisis has not been commensurate to the scale of the challenge7. Some argue that universities’ efforts comprise too many ‘bottom up’, unsupported efforts8 and the public declarations have not translated into systemic change. With the intensification of the environmental crises demand for change is intensifying. For example, a recent SDG values report by the Times Higher Education (THE) suggests that students strongly value climate action, quality education and strong institutions, and 82% of them felt it was important for sustainability to be embedded in their everyday lives9.\nA recent survey by ECO UNESCO with young people in Ireland found an overwhelming majority (93%) wanted climate action to be a larger part of their educational experience Further, most respondents expressed anxiety about climate change, an interest in green jobs and a desire for their places of work or study to be more environmentally friendly10. This is in keeping with recent research in the United Kingdom, which found that one in three 18–24-year-olds had turned down a job because the company’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments were not in line with their values11. Students are also exerting pressure for action through their activism including the Fridays for the Future, the Fossil Fuel Divestment movements12.\nSimilarly, staff are increasgly calling on IHE leadership to respond in more concrete ways to an escalating crisis13. To varying extents IHE sector is making increasing efforts to respond. For example, performance in meeting SDG targets has been appraised by a growing number of academic ranking agencies including the prestigious Times Higher Education rankings."

    "text": "University College Dublin\n\n\n\nUniversity College Dublin has stated its climate ambitions in its organizational mission statements and action plans. acknowledged the need to ‘live sustainably without degrading its shared planet’ and celebrated UCD’s ‘long-standing commitment to sustainability’ 14 Specifically, commitment towards a sustainable future is at the core of UCD’s Strategic Plan looking to embed the principles of sustainability in the University community through research and teaching, promoting research that advances the SDGs including SDG13 Climate Action. A key indicator for this goal is building knowledge and capacity to meet climate change by raising awareness and improving education. Further UCD and each publicly funded IHEs are considered a ‘public sector body’ under the Climate Action Plan, Therefore, the organization is expected to act as a leader in climate action as noted in the 2023 plan (p.103) “We will lead by example, embedding climate action as a central value across all public sector organizations, relentlessly focusing on continuous improvements that deliver real progress”15. This year UCD rose 12 points to No. 22 in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings for its commitment to SDGs. Clearly, momentum is building.\n\nAims of the study\nAs the University, implements changes to meet the evolving needs of its constituents, engagement with ongoing the stakeholders is critical To this end, the College of Social Sciences and Law provided our research team with funding to investigate students’ understandings of, attitudes towards and actions against climate change.\nResearch questions\n\n\nDo UCD undergraduate students possess basic knowledge about the underlying drivers and impacts of climate change?\nAre students satisfied with the amount of current teaching at the university about climate change?\nWhat is the level of eco-anxiety among undergraduate students at UCD?\nWhat portion of the students are involved in some form of environmental activism?\nHow can the College /University support students who want to become more engaged in environmental issues?\n\n\nThe project was based on a collaboration between the School of Education and the School of Social policy, Social work and Social justice Where possible, we used to establish psychometric scales that have been validated for use with student populations. For context, we compare the students’ scores across key metrics to those of Irish adult and or youth populations."

    "text": "Knowledge\n\nGeneral knowledge\nWhen asked about how much they know in relation to climate change 92% of students indicate that they know a lot or a moderate amount about it. This percentage is lower among students from the CoSSL (88%).\n\n\nSpecific knowledge\nBased on questions developed by the OECD 1, students were asked to what extent they could explain some issues related to climate change. Among all issues, UCD students find the easiest to explain why some countries suffer more from global climate change than others, with 81% stating that they could do this easily or, at least, with some effort. This aspect is also mentioned as one of the easiest for 15-year-old participants of the OECD assessment across 66 countries, with a similar proportion of 72% on average. On the other hand, the hardest aspect to explain according to UCD students is how economic crises in single countries affect the global economy, with only half of the respondents indicating that they could do this easily or with a bit of effort.\nThere are also significant differences across colleges. Only 68% of CoSSL students indicate that they can explain how carbon dioxide emissions affect global climate change compared to 90% of their colleagues from other colleges. Conversely, 83% of CoSSL can Discuss the different reasons why people become refugees and only 69% of respondents from other colleges can do that easily or with some effort.\n\n\nInformation sources\nThe most cited source of information about the environmental crisis that UCD respondents rely on is News Sites (86%) followed by Environmental organisations (53%) and Instagram (50%). The least cited sources are Facebook (6%) and Youth groups (7%). Located also at the bottom of the ranking, only 17% of students mentioned that they rely on information from other sources at UCD (outside of lectures), with 41% of them relying on information from modules/lectures in UCD."

The groups that present the highest proportion of thinking about it daily are female students (23%) and those coming from rural areas (24%). In addition, half of the respondents indicated that they are very or extremely worried about climate change. These levels are also higher among female students (57%) and CoSSL students 53%.\nTo investigate this worry in more detail, researchers asked participants to what extent they were worried because of the consequences of climate change to determined groups. 84% of respondents indicated that they were very or extremely worried about the consequences to Future generations and only 22% stated that they were very/extremely worried about the consequences to their lifestyles now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of very/extremely worried students is higher in the CoSSL compared to other colleges for all groups.

    "text": "Action\nUCD students were also asked to what extent some groups should be acting more or less to address climate change. For 79% of the students, “Business” should be acting much more to address climate change. This is the highest proportion followed by “Government” (78%) and “Politicians” (71%). Only 36% of respondents indicated that “Citizens” should act much more and 19% responded that “themselves” should be acting much more to address climate change.\nThis emphasis on Government’s responsibility corroborates the results from a national survey conducted in 2021 with the Irish adult population 2. One of the survey items asked if climate change should be a very high, high, medium, or low priority for the Government of Ireland. Among the population, 42% indicated a very high priority, and 37% responded that a high priority should be given. The same question was asked to UCD students, with 62% indicating a very high priority and 28% a high priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth surveys also asked when climate change will start to harm people in Ireland. Results from the national survey showed that 47% of the population believes that climate change is already starting to harm people in Ireland. 22% responded in 10 years, 29% in 25 years or more and 2% said that climate change will never harm people in Ireland. The same question was asked to UCD students with 56% saying that people are already being harmed now, 27% responding in 10 years and 1% saying that climate change will never harm people in Ireland.\nFinally, in relation to climate-friendly actions that UCD students have taken in the previous 12 months, 71% mentioned “Talked with family and friends about climate change”. This is the most cited action followed by “Punished a company by NOT buying their products because of their contribution to climate change” (54%) and “Reduced your meat and/or dairy intake for environmental reasons” (53%). Some actions have different levels of support across students from the CoSSL and other colleges as indicated in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Table 1.

This proportion is similar among students from CoSSL (44%) and other colleges (42%).\nThe proportion of female students who indicated that UCD provided enough opportunities to learn about climate change is significantly lower (38%), compared to non-female students (51%).\n\n\nPro-Environmental Activities\nOnly 1 in 3 students in UCD indicated that there have been enough opportunities to become involved in activities (such as volunteering) related to climate change and environment.\nThe percentage of students from CoSSL who declared having those opportunities is lower (29%) than those from other colleges (36%).\nIn the same way that was observed for learning opportunities, the proportion of respondents who said that UCD provided opportunities to act is lower among female students (28%), compared to non-female students (41%).\n\n\nBarriers to Climate-Friendly Action and Lifestyle Changes\nThe survey also asked participants what barriers students in UCD face to take climate-friendly action and lifestyle changes. The most cited barrier is that “Most students have other more pressing problems that take most of their attention e.g. course work”, mentioned by 70% of the students, 64% among CoSSL and 68% among female students.\nThe other top cited barriers are “Most students don’t have enough knowledge on climate change” (55%) and “Most students don’t have the skills e.g. public speaking / organising” (46%)\n\n\nOpportunities for Further Learning\nFinally, participants also indicated several topics related to climate change that they would like to learn more about at UCD.
