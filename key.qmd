### Remaining Evidence Gaps 

- **Evidence of UCD students’ climate literacy**. While this exploratory study allows us to identify students’ self-reported awareness and understanding of the climate crisis, further research needs to be conducted to investigate the levels of climate literacy among UCD students.

- **Evidence of the opportunities available in UCD to engage in climate action**. The present study shows students perceived as scarce opportunities offered in UCD to engage in actions to address climate change and protect the environment. Further work is needed to compile and articulate the existing initiatives, services and opportunities available in UCD to engage in climate-friendly actions. 

- **Evidence on students’ preferences to incorporate climate action into their student  experience at UCD**. The study demonstrates the interest of students in engaging in climate-friendly actions and have further opportunities as part of the UCD student experience and preparation for their professional future. Further research is needed to identify what experiential opportunities students are interested in that could inform programmes and initiatives across the University that could be developed in partnership with relevant stakeholders such as UCDVO Volunteer Programme, UCD Career Service, Student Union, student clubs and societies.

- **Evidence on the impact of the climate crisis in students mental health**. Even though the results of this exploratory study show that the majority of students anxiety regarding climate change focuses on future generationsn, most students are constantly thinking about the climate crisis and a fair proportion of them reported to be concerned about its current consequences. With growing research exploring sustainable wellbeing - how humans care for themselves, others, and the environment-, further evidence is needed in UCD on the specific impact of climate change has in students’ mental health and overall wellbeing. 

# Key Takeaways

:::

1.	Importance of climate education research  

Funding is needed to address the evidence gaps identified in this study and to develop a research agenda on climate education at UCD that provides evidence-based strategies needed for our students to effectively develop climate literacy and skills necessary to engage in meaningful climate action within and beyond the University. These goals are not only aligned with UCD’s Strategy Plan and commitment to ‘Create a Sustainable Global Society’ but are also part of the commitments of Higher Education Institutions as part of the Public Sector Climate Action Mandate established in Ireland’s Climate Action Plan 2023. This education agenda should have a student-centric approach that identifies and works towards addressing students' needs and concerns with methodologies that promote the engagement of students as partners in the design, implementation and evaluation of projects.

## Recommendation
Allocate research funding for internal projects at UCD that create evidence in partnership with students on climate education including knowledge, skills, attitudes and dispositions to take action against climate change.
:::

2.	Need for a Climate Curricular Alignment   

The present study demonstrates that students do not rely on UCD as a key source of information about the climate crisis demonstrating the need for a curricular alignment that makes climate change part of the University / College-wide curriculum to allow students to engage with the issue. A ‘climate curricular alignment’in UCD would map the content relevant to climate change across the University / College, coordinate current learning outcomes of different modules and programmes and to map learning trajectories for students’ climate education. Consultation with students should lead the curricular alignment to better understand their needs and concerns and would align with the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development that looks to transform learning environments through whole institutional approaches to promote knowledge, skills, values and dispositions to promote sustainable development.

## Recommendation
Develop a ‘climate curricular alignment’ initiative to identify how different programmes and modules could contribute to improving climate knowledge and skills among our students.

3.	Relevance of experiential opportunities  

The study emphasised the relevance of experiential opportunities for students and the impact these can have on their climate literacy and engagement with climate actions. UCD should work towards articulating existing opportunities for students or creating new ones that are relevant for them to address climate change. The National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development sets concrete outcomes about providing students with experiences of sustainability within education and supporting young people to become agents of change. Partnerships across stakeholders in the University, such as UCDVO Volunteer Programme, UCD Career Service, Student Union, student clubs and societies, are essential in the achievement of these outcomes. For example, helping them to link the knowledge and skills they are developing in their programmes with volunteering and career opportunities that would allow them to engage in meaningful action.

## Recommendation
Work in collaboration with areas across the Universtiy to disseminate available opportunities and to create new initiatives for students to engage in climate action, in particular volunteering and career opportunities.
