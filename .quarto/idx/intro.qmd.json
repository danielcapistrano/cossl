Further, IHEs are tasked with educating and supporting future leaders who will need to deal with the long-term legacy of environmental degradation and have a key role to play in supporting advocacy for transformative social change [^3]. \n\nA growing scholarship is conceptualizing how IHEs can be most useful as constructive actors in a time-bound emergency such as climate change[^4]. Thousands of universities, including Irish HEIs, have joined campaigns are responding by made emergency declarations[^5] and the sector has identified climate change and biodiversity loss as a priority focus[^6].\n\n:::{.column-page}\n![](./img/campus.jpg)\n:::\n\nHowever, many argue that IHE's response to the climate crisis has not been commensurate to the scale of the challenge[^7]. Some argue that universities’ efforts comprise too many ‘bottom up’, unsupported efforts[^8] and the public declarations have not translated into systemic change. With the intensification of the environmental crises demand for change is intensifying. For example, a recent SDG values report by the Times Higher Education (THE) suggests that students strongly value climate action, quality education and strong institutions, and 82% of them felt it was important for sustainability to be embedded in their everyday lives[^9].\n\nA recent survey by ECO UNESCO with young people in Ireland found an overwhelming majority (93%) wanted climate action to be a larger part of their educational experience Further, most respondents expressed anxiety about climate change, an interest in green jobs and a desire for their places of work or study to be more environmentally friendly[^10]. This is in keeping with recent research in the United Kingdom, which found that one in three 18–24-year-olds had turned down a job because the company’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments were not in line with their values[^11]. Students are also exerting pressure for action  through their activism including the Fridays for the Future, the Fossil Fuel Divestment movements[^12]. \n\nSimilarly, staff  are increasgly calling on IHE leadership to respond in more concrete ways to an escalating crisis[^13]. To varying extents  IHE sector is making increasing efforts to respond. For example, performance in meeting SDG targets has been appraised by a growing number of academic ranking agencies including the prestigious Times Higher Education rankings. \n\n[^1]: ALLEA, “Towards Climate Sustainability of the Academic System in Europe and Beyond”; UNESCO, “Beyond Limits.

A key indicator for this goal is building knowledge and capacity to meet climate change by raising awareness and improving education. \nFurther UCD and each publicly funded IHEs are considered a ‘public sector body’ under the Climate Action Plan, Therefore, the organization is expected to act as a leader in climate action as noted in the 2023 plan (p.103) “We will lead by example, embedding climate action as a central value across all public sector organizations, relentlessly focusing on continuous improvements that deliver real progress”[^15]. This year UCD rose 12 points to No. 22 in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings for its commitment to SDGs. Clearly, momentum is building.\n\n[^14]: University College Dublin, “Rising the Future UCD Strategy 2020-2024.”\n[^15]: Government of Ireland, “Climate Action Plan  2023 Changing Ireland for the Better.”\n\n\n\n### Aims of the study\n\nAs the University, implements changes to meet the evolving needs of its constituents,  engagement with ongoing the stakeholders is critical To this end, the College of Social Sciences and Law  provided our research team with funding to investigate students’ understandings of, attitudes towards and actions against climate change.\n\n**Research questions**  \n\n> 1.\tDo UCD undergraduate students possess basic knowledge about the underlying drivers and impacts of climate change?\n2.\tAre students satisfied with the amount of current teaching at the university about climate change?\n3.\tWhat is the level of eco-anxiety among undergraduate students at UCD?\n4.\tWhat portion of the students are involved in some form of environmental activism?\n5.\tHow can the College /University support students who want to become more engaged in environmental issues?  \n\n\nThe project was based on a collaboration between the School of Education and the School of Social policy, Social work and Social justice \nWhere possible, we used to establish psychometric scales that have been validated for use with student populations. For context, we compare the students’ scores across key metrics to those of Irish adult and or youth populations.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":false,"code-tools":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":false,"output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["lumen","styles.scss"],"title":"Introduction"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
