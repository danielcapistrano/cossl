Further, IHEs are tasked with educating and supporting future leaders who will need to deal with the long-term legacy of environmental degradation and have a key role to play in supporting advocacy for transformative social change [^2]. \n\nA growing scholarship is conceptualizing how IHEs can be most useful as constructive actors in a time-bound emergency such as climate change[^3]. Thousands of universities, including Irish HEIs, have joined campaigns are responding by made emergency declarations[^4] and the sector has identified climate change and biodiversity loss as a priority focus[^5].\n\n:::{.column-page}\n![](./img/campus.jpg)\n:::\n\nHowever, many argue that IHE's response to the climate crisis has not been commensurate to the scale of the challenge[^6]. Some argue that universities’ efforts comprise too many ‘bottom up’, unsupported efforts[^7] and the public declarations have not translated into systemic change. With the intensification of the environmental crises demand for change is intensifying. For example, a recent SDG values report by the Times Higher Education (THE) suggests that students strongly value climate action, quality education and strong institutions, and 82% of them felt it was important for sustainability to be embedded in their everyday lives[^8].\n\nA recent survey by ECO UNESCO with young people in Ireland found an overwhelming majority (93%) wanted climate action to be a larger part of their educational experience. Further, most respondents expressed anxiety about climate change, an interest in green jobs and a desire for their places of work or study to be more environmentally friendly[^9]. This is in keeping with recent research in the United Kingdom, which found that one in three 18–24-year-olds had turned down a job because the company’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments were not in line with their values[^10]. Students are also exerting pressure for action  through their activism including the Fridays for the Future, the Fossil Fuel Divestment movements[^11]. \n\nSimilarly, staff  are increasgly calling on IHE leadership to respond in more concrete ways to an escalating crisis[^12]. To varying extents  IHE sector is making increasing efforts to respond. For example, performance in meeting SDG targets has been appraised by a growing number of academic ranking agencies including the prestigious Times Higher Education rankings. \n\n[^1]: ALLEA, “Towards Climate Sustainability of the Academic System in Europe and Beyond”; UNESCO, “Beyond Limits.
