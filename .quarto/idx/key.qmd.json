While this exploratory study allows us to identify students’ self-reported awareness and understanding of the climate crisis, further research needs to be conducted to investigate the levels of climate literacy among UCD students.\n\n- **Evidence of the opportunities available in UCD to engage in climate action**. The present study shows students perceived as scarce opportunities offered in UCD to engage in actions to address climate change and protect the environment. Further work is needed to compile and articulate the existing initiatives, services and opportunities available in UCD to engage in climate-friendly actions. Only 5% of students reported engaging with public officials despite the high levels of concern about the issue. There are opportunities to help students build skills and confidence to become more civically engaged.\n\n- **Evidence on students’ preferences to incorporate climate action into their student  experience at UCD**. The study demonstrates the interest of students in engaging in climate-friendly actions and have further opportunities as part of the UCD student experience and preparation for their professional future. Further research is needed to identify what experiential opportunities students are interested in that could inform programmes and initiatives across the University that could be developed in partnership with relevant stakeholders such as UCDVO Volunteer Programme, UCD Career Service, Student Union, student clubs and societies.\n\n- **Evidence on the impact of the climate crisis in students mental health**. The results of this exploratory study show that the majority of students are worried about climate change, most students are constantly thinking about the climate crisis and a large proportion of them reported to be concerned about its current consequences.

A climate curricular alignment in UCD would map the content relevant to climate change across the University / College, coordinate current learning outcomes of different modules and programmes and to map learning trajectories for students' climate education.
